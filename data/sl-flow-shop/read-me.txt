Let m1 be the number of machines of semi-line 1, and m2 be the number of machines of semi-line 2.

n: number of jobs

m: m1 + m2 + 2 (number of machines in each same line plus 2 since final synchronization machine is duplicated)

matrix of processing times machine x job

line 1: processing times of the jobs in the first machine of semi-line 1
line 2: processing times of the jobs in the second machine of semi-line 1
…
line m1: processing times of the jobs in the last machine of semi-line 1
line m1+1: processing times of the jobs in thefinal synchronization machine
line m1+2: processing times of the jobs in the first machine of semi-line 2
…
line m1+m2+1: processing times of the jobs in the last machine of semi-line 2
line m1+m2+2: processing times of the jobs in the first machine of semi-line 2 (duplicated from line m1+1)
