class PermFlowShop:
    """
    Class to represent a permutation flow-shop scheduling problem
    with lower bounds computed by the max of a single machine and
    a two machine relaxations.

    The bounds for single and two-machine problems are described
    by Potts (1980), also implemented by Ladhari & Haouari (2005),
    therein described as 'LB1' and 'LB5'.

    If the attribute `constructive` is 'neh', the heuristic
    of Nawaz et al. (1983) is adopted, otherwise
    the strategy by Palmer (1965).
